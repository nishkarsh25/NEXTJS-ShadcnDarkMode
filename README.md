## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nishkarsh25/NEXTJS-ShadcnDarkMode.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```
   Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to checkout.
   

3. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## How to Use

### Light/Dark Mode Toggle
- **Description**: Users can switch between light and dark themes to suit their preference.
- **How to Use**: Click the theme toggle button in the navigation bar. The icon will change between a sun (for light mode) and a moon (for dark mode), indicating the current theme.

### Shadcn UI Integration
- **Description**: The project uses Shadcn UI for custom-styled buttons and other UI components.
- **How to Use**: Components from Shadcn UI are pre-configured in the project. The theme toggle button, for instance, is styled using Shadcn UI's button component.

### Responsive Navigation Bar
- **Description**: The navigation bar is responsive and includes links to different sections of the application along with the theme toggle button.
- **How to Use**: Navigate through the application by clicking the links in the navigation bar (e.g., Dashboard, Users, Tickets). The navigation bar will adjust its layout based on the screen size.

### Next.js Server-Side Rendering
- **Description**: Efficient server-side rendering and static site generation are handled by Next.js.
- **How to Use**: No additional steps are required by the user. This feature ensures that the application loads quickly and performs well.

### TypeScript
- **Description**: Ensures type safety throughout the application, reducing bugs and improving developer experience.
- **How to Use**: Developers can write TypeScript code, which will be type-checked during development. TypeScript configuration is already set up in the project.

### Theme Management with next-themes
- **Description**: Seamless theme management is provided by the next-themes library.
- **How to Use**: The theme management is integrated into the ToggleMode component. Users can change themes using the toggle button, and the selected theme is remembered across sessions.
